# `notes-app` - A Notes.app CLI

A command line interface for Notes.app on macOS.
**Notes.app access is apparently [broken in 10.15 Calatina](https://github.com/xwmx/notes-app-cli/issues/1)**
and other versions of macOS, but appears to be working again as of macOS 14 Sonoma.

Add and edit notes in a text editor with command line support like Vim, Emacs,
VS Code, Sublime Text, etc. Create, list, view, update, and delete notes using
simple terminal commands. Export your notes to text files.

## Quirks and Limitations

- Requires macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier ([broken in 10.15 Calatina](https://github.com/xwmx/notes-app-cli/issues/1)),
  or macOS 14 Sonoma and higher.
- Notes.app must be open. `notes-app` will open it in background if it's
    not already open.
- Attachments are not supported. Apple doesn't provide easy access to
    attachments syned with iCloud. Editing a note that contains
    an attachment results in the attachment being removed. In order to
    avoid data loss, `notes-app` does not allow editing or updating notes
    that have attachments.
- The formatting of the first line in a note is not preserved. Notes.app treats
    the first line of a note as the "name" of the note and does not allow
    formatting of this line through AppleScript, while the "body" of the note
    is formatted with HTML. When the note has a blank "name" line, the first
    line of the "body" is treated as the name, making any formatting on that
    line inaccessible to `notes-app`.
- If a new note is created without a "name" specified, Notes.app sets the
    first line to "New Note".

Overall warning: Notes.app data is not fully accessible and some things get
lost in translation. `notes-app` makes an effort to provide access to the raw
data from Notes.app and has a few checks to avoid data issues, but Notes.app
still does processing on its end (e.g., adding HTML tags), so expect some
weirdness when updating and editing existing notes that have a lot of
formatting.

## Installation

### Homebrew

Install with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash

### Subcommands

#### `accounts`

```text
Usage:
  notes-app accounts [show <account>] [--properties <prop1>,<prop2>]

Options:
  --properties <prop1>,<prop2>  A comma-separated list of property names to
                                include in the output. Set to 'all' to include
                                all properties.

Identifiers:
  <account> can be identified with one of the following:
    id      The Notes.app core data id (starts with 'x-coredata://').
    name    The name property.
    number  The current sequence number.

Available Properties:
  all
  id
  name

Subcommands:
  (default)  List all accounts.
  show       Show properties of <account>.

Description:
  List accounts or show an account.

Examples:
  # list accounts by name
  notes-app accounts

  # list accounts with ids and names
  notes-app accounts --properties id,name

  # print the id and name of the iCloud account
  notes-app accounts show "iCloud"
```

#### `add`

```text
Usage:
  notes-app add [<name>] [--account <account>] [--body <body>] [--folder <folder>]

Options:
  --account <account>  The account containing the new note.
  --body    <body>     Plain text or HTML body content.
  --folder  <folder>   The folder containing the new note.

Identifiers:
  <account> and <folder> can be identified with one of the following:
    id      The Notes.app core data id (starts with 'x-coredata://').
    name    The name property.
    number  The current sequence number.

Description:
  Add a new note. When no arguments are specified, a new blank note file is
  opened in the terminal editor, as set in the `$EDITOR` environment
  variable.

  When <name> is specified, the editor is not opened and a new note is created
  containing the specified <name> as the first line of the note.

Note Format:
  The format of each note provided by Notes.app consists of:
    Line  1:     An unformatted string representing the "Name" property.
    Lines 2-end: An HTML formatted body.
  Within Notes.app the first line can be formatted, but this formatting is not
  preserved when the note is retrieved or set via AppleScript, so any
  formatting in this line will likely be lost or inconsistent with what's
  displayed in Notes.app.


Examples:
  # Open a new note in the editor.
  notes-app add

  # Create a new note named "Example name." without opening editor.
  notes-app add "Example name."

 # Create a new note with a name and body without opening editor.
